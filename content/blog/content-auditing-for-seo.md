# Content Auditing for SEO: How to Prune Your Way to the Top in 2025

The biggest mistake in 2025 content strategy is "publishing and forgetting." As the web becomes more crowded, search engines prioritize domains with a high average content quality. **Content auditing for SEO** is the process of reviewing your entire library and deciding which pages to Keep, Update, Merge, or Delete.

## The Audit Framework
1. **The Inventory**: Use a crawler to list every URL on your site.
2. **The Performance Check**: Cross-reference URLs with traffic and ranking data from our [LINK: technical-seo-audit-2025].
3. **The 'Keep, Update, Delete' Filter**: 
    - **Keep**: High-performing cornerstone content.
    - **Update**: Content that is falling in rankings but still relevant.
    - **Delete/Redirect**: Low-quality or duplicate pages that dilute your "Quality Signal."
