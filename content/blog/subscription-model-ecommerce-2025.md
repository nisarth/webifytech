# Building a Successful E-Commerce Subscription Model in 2025

The most valuable business is one with predictable, recurring revenue. In 2025, the **ecommerce subscription model** has evolved from "boxes of stuff" to "curated convenience." Whether you are selling coffee or specialized [LINK: services], subscriptions are the key to high customer lifetime value (LTV).

## The Three Main Models
1. **Replenishment**: Automated re-orders of consumables (e.g., razor blades, pet food).
2. **Curation**: Sending a unique selection of items each month (e.g., wine, beauty products).
3. **Access**: Paying for exclusive perks, discounts, or early launches (as seen in our [LINK: portfolio]).
