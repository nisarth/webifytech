# Low-Code vs. Custom Development 2025: Finding the Right Path

In 2025, you don't always need to write code to build a great app. The rise of **Low-Code vs. Custom Development** has given businesses more options than ever. But with more options comes more confusion. Choosing the wrong path can lead to a "dead end" where you outgrow your platform and have to start over.

## Low-Code: The MVP Accelerator
Platforms like Webflow or Shopify are perfect for getting to market fast.
- **Pros**: Rapid launch, lower initial cost, and easy for non-developers to edit.
- **Cons**: "Vendor lock-in" and performance limitations as seen in our [LINK: technical-seo-audit-2025].

## Custom Development: The Infinite Edge
Building with a framework like Next.js (as we do for our [LINK: services]) provides total control.
- **Pros**: Unmatched speed, proprietary equity, and the ability to scale to millions of users in our [LINK: portfolio].
- **Cons**: higher initial investment and requires professional maintenance.
