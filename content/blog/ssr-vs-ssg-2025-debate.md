# Server-Side Rendering vs. Static Site Generation: The 2025 Performance Debate

In 2025, the question is no longer "Should I use a framework?" but "How should I render my content?" The debate between **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** and **Static Site Generation (SSG)** has evolved with the rise of edge computing and partial hydration. Choosing the right strategy is the most critical technical decision you will make for your [LINK: services].

## SSG: The Performance King
SSG pre-builds your pages during the deployment process.
- **Pros**: Instant load times, massive SEO benefits, and virtually zero hosting cost.
- **Cons**: Slow builds for sites with millions of pages and difficulty with real-time data.

## SSR: The Dynamic Powerhouse
SSR generates the HTML for each page on every request.
- **Pros**: Perfect for personalized dashboards, real-time inventories, and user-specific content.
- **Cons**: Higher server load and slightly slower "Time to First Byte" (TTFB).

## The 2025 Hybrid Approach
In our latest [LINK: portfolio] projects, we use **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)**. This allows us to keep the speed of SSG while updating content in the background as often as every 60 seconds.

## Conclusion: Which is for you?
If you are building a blog or a marketing site, SSG is the clear winner. If you are building a SaaS or a social platform, SSR is necessary.

## FAQ

### What is the difference between SSR and SSG?
SSG builds the site once at the start; SSR builds each page whenever a user visits.

### Is Next.js better for SSR or SSG?
Next.js is the industry leader because it lets you choose the rendering strategy on a *per-page* basis.

### Does rendering affect SEO?
Yes. Pre-rendered HTML (both SSR and SSG) is much easier for search bots to crawl than "Client-Side Rendering" where the bot has to execute JavaScript. This is a core part of our [LINK: technical-seo-audit-2025].
