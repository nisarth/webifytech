A site migration—whether it’s a domain change, a re-platforming to [LINK: shopify-vs-custom-ecommerce-2025], or a massive design overhaul—is one of the most high-risk events in a brand's digital life.

## Why 2025 Migrations are Different
- **AI Crawling Recalibration**: [LINK: ai-powered-search-seo-2025] bots re-evaluate your topical authority (E-E-A-T) the moment they detect major structural changes.
- **Real-Time Indexing Sensitivity**: With tools like GSC (see [LINK: google-search-console-guide-2025]), Google can pick up on link errors faster than ever.
- **Core Web Vital Impacts**: A new site must match or exceed the performance of the old one to maintain rankings. (See [LINK: technical-seo-audit-2025]).

---

## Phase 1: Pre-Migration Benchmarking
You cannot measure success if you don't know your starting point.
- **Full Domain Crawl**: Use tools to map every URL, title tag, and meta description on your current site.
- **Backlink Profile Audit**: Identify your strongest pages based on [LINK: advanced-backlink-strategies-2025] data. These are the pages you *cannot* afford to break.
- **Performance Baseline**: Record your current speed and [LINK: technical-seo-audit-2025] metrics.

---

## Phase 2: The Redirection Map (The Most Critical Step)
A 404 (File Not Found) error is a "leak" in your authority.
- **1-to-1 Mapping**: Every old URL must have a corresponding new URL.
- **301 Redirects**: Use permanent (301) redirects to tell Google: "This content has moved forever." (Essential for your [LINK: ecommerce SEO strategy]).
- **Avoid Redirect Loops**: Multiple hops (A -> B -> C) dilute "link juice" and slow down the site. (Learn about speed in [LINK: serverless-architecture-2025]).

---

## Phase 3: Technical Content Integrity
Don't just migrate URLs; migrate your [LINK: semantic-seo-guide-2025] authority.
- **Structured Data (Schema)**: Ensure your [LINK: local-seo-guide-2025] data, product info, and FAQs are correctly implemented on the new site.
- **Canonical Tags**: Tell Google which version of the page is the "Master" version to prevent duplicate content issues.
- **Image and Asset Optimization**: Modernize your media for the new site using [LINK: progressive-web-apps-2025] patterns.

---

## Phase 4: The Post-Migration Audit (Launch Day)
The first 48 hours are critical.
- **GSC Search Console Refresh**: Submit your new XML sitemap and use the inspection tool for your "Money Pages." (Follow our [LINK: google-search-console-guide-2025]).
- **Crawl for Errors**: Instantly crawl the new site to identify 404s, 5xx errors, or accidental `noindex` tags.
- **Test UX and Conversion**: Ensure your [LINK: optimizing-checkout-conversion-2025] and contact forms are working perfectly on the new infrastructure.

---

## Phase 5: Monitoring and Correction
Expect some volatility, but monitor closely.
- **Weekly Performance Review**: Check for ranking fluctuations and indexation gaps (like the "Discovered - currently not indexed" issue we're solving).
- **Update Social and External Links**: Change the "Link in Bio" on social media and reach out to high-authority partners to update their [LINK: advanced-backlink-strategies-2025] links.
- **Analyze [LINK: about] page traffic**: Users often visit the About page to verify a brand during a major redesign. Use [LINK: micro-copy-mastery-for-conversion] here to build new trust.

## FAQ

### How long does a migration impact rankings?
Even with a perfect migration, you may see 2-4 weeks of "Search Volatility" as Google re-crawls your site. Most sites recover fully or exceed their old rankings within 6-8 weeks if the technical foundation is improved (see [LINK: serverless-architecture-2025]).

### Can I migrate my site without an agency?
For small sites (<50 pages), a careful manual migration is possible. For e-commerce or enterprise sites, the risk of data loss and ranking drops is too high. We recommend our [LINK: services] for these complex projects.

### Is it a good idea to change my domain?
Only if necessary for branding. Domain changes carry the highest risk since you are essentially starting a new relationship with Google. If you must do it, follow our [LINK: international-seo-guide-2025] and migration protocols to the letter.

### What is the most common migration mistake?
Failing to map old "Secondary" pages. Brands often migrate their top 10 pages but forget the hundreds of [LINK: semantic-seo-guide-2025] support articles that provide the "Topical Authority" for the main pages.

### Does "Headless" make migration easier?
Yes! Because the content is managed separately in a [LINK: headless-cms-benefits-2025], you can redesign the frontend (the "head") without risking the integrity of your core content and [LINK: technical-seo-audit-2025] data.
