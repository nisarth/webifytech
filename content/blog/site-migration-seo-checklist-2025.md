# Site Migration SEO Checklist: Moving Without Losing Traffic in 2025

A site migration—whether you are changing your domain, moving to a new hosting provider, or switching your CMS (e.g., from WordPress to a custom Next.js build)—is one of the most high-stakes operations in digital marketing. Without a careful plan, you risk losing months or even years of organic growth overnight. In 2025, the key to a successful move is precision. This **site migration SEO checklist** ensures you keep your rankings while you upgrade your tech.

> "A migration is like moving a library. If you don't keep track of which book goes on which shelf, your readers (and search engines) will never find them again." — SEO Migration Lead, WebifyTech

## The Prep Phase: Before You Move

Success is determined before you ever touch a server.
- [ ] **Full Site Crawl**: Create a complete list of your current URLs. This is your "source of truth."
- [ ] **Benchmarking**: Record your current rankings and organic traffic levels so you can measure the impact of the move.
- [ ] **Staging Environment**: Never migrate directly to live. Build your new site on a "staging" domain and block it from search engines while we perform our [LINK: services] testing.

## The Technical Migration Checklist

- [ ] **Mapping 301 Redirects**: Map every old URL to its most relevant new URL. Avoid sending all redirects to the homepage; this is a major ranking signal loss.
- [ ] **Update Internal Links**: Ensure all links within your content point to the new URLs, not the old ones.
- [ ] **Canonical Tag Audit**: Verify that your "canonical" tags reflect the new domain or structure.
- [ ] **XML Sitemap Update**: Submit your new sitemap to Google Search Console immediately after the move.

## Post-Migration Monitoring

The work doesn't end when the site goes live. We monitor our clients' sites in the [LINK: portfolio] for 30 days post-migration to:
1. Check for a sudden spike in 404 errors.
2. Verify that redirects are triggering correctly.
3. Monitor Google Search Console for any indexing warnings.

## Conclusion: Moving with Confidence

Migration is an opportunity for growth, not a reason for fear. By following this **site migration SEO checklist**, you can transition to a faster, more modern platform without sacrificing your hard-earned authority.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Will a site migration always cause a traffic drop?
A small, temporary fluctuation is normal as Google re-crawls the site. However, with a perfect redirect strategy, your traffic should stabilize or even increase within 2-4 weeks.

### How do I handle 301 redirects?
Use a "one-to-one" mapping strategy. If you have an article about "Apples," redirect the old URL to the new "Apples" page, not a general "Fruit" category or the Homepage.

### Can I change my domain and my CMS at the same time?
Yes, but it adds complexity. We recommend performing these migrations in stages if possible (e.g., move to the new CMS first, then change the domain) to isolate any potential issues.

### Does site speed improve after migration?
If you are moving to a modern framework like Next.js (as we do in our [LINK: services]), you will see a massive improvement in page speed, which can lead to higher rankings in the long term.

### What is the biggest mistake in site migration?
Forgetting to unblock the staging site from `robots.txt` after going live, or failing to submit the new sitemap to Google Search Console.
