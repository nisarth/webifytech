## The Components of a Premium Web Project

We break down our projects into four main investment categories:

### 1. Strategy and Discovery (15% of budget)
This is the "brain" of your project. We research your competitors, define your user personas, and map out the technical requirements. Without this phase, your site will be beautiful but ineffective.

### 2. Design and User Experience (25% of budget)
This covers the UI/UX architecture. We create custom designs that are tailored to your brand, ensuring that functionality and aesthetics work in harmony. This includes mobile optimization and accessibility testing.

### 3. Engineering and Development (40% of budget)
The "engine room." This is where our developers write clean, scalable code using frameworks like Next.js. This phase includes backend integrations, API connections, and the implementation of our high-performance [LINK: services] features.

### 4. Quality Assurance and Launch (20% of budget)
Before launch, every element is tested across dozens of device configurations. We verify site speed, security protocols, and SEO foundations to ensure a flawless first impression.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What are the most expensive parts of web development?
The most significant costs usually come from custom backend logic and complex third-party integrations (like E-RP or custom CRM connections). These require senior-level engineering and extensive security testing.

### Why do hourly rates vary so much in 2025?
Rates reflect the quality of the team and the depth of the service. A junior freelancer has a low rate but may lack the strategic and SEO expertise provided by a full-service agency like WebifyTech during the [LINK: about] phase of a partnership.

### Is it better to pay more upfront or pay monthly?
For most businesses, an upfront investment in a custom platform leads to lower long-term costs. "Website-as-a-service" models often end up costing more over 3 years while offering less flexibility.

### What is the ROI of a custom website?
While it varies by industry, high-performing B2B sites typically see a 50-100% increase in lead conversion rates after a custom rebuild, often paying for themselves within 6-12 months.

### How much should I budget for maintenance?
Plan to spend approximately 10-20% of the initial development cost annually on maintenance, security updates, and iterative performance improvements.
