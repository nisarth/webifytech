The "Local Pack" (or Map Pack) is the set of three businesses that appear at the top of Google Search results with a map. In 2025, this section captures over 50% of all local clicks. To rank here, you must optimize for Google’s three local pillars: Relevance, Distance, and Prominence.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How important is Google Business Profile for local SEO?
It is the single most important factor. An optimized and active Google Business Profile is responsible for approximately 35-40% of your local ranking power.

Focus on proximity (distance to the user), relevance (how well your profile matches the search), and prominence (your overall brand authority and review profile).

Only when your business information (NAP) changes. However, you should audit your citations annually to ensure no incorrect data has been scraped or generated by third-party sites during the [LINK: about] phase of your digital growth.
